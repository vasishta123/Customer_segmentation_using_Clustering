# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering

This repository contains the code for a customer segmentation project using KMeans clustering. The aim of this project is to segment customers based on their purchase behavior in a mall. The data provided includes demographic information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Algorithm Selection

To identify distinct customer segments, a combination of clustering algorithms has been employed in this project. The algorithms used are:

1. Hierarchical Clustering
2. Agglomerative Clustering
3. DBSCAN
4. Gaussian Mixture Models
5. OPTICS
6. K-means Clustering

By utilizing these algorithms, we can uncover different groups of customers based on their purchasing patterns and demographics.

## Evaluation and Insights

The quality of segmentation results is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of how well the clustering algorithms perform in identifying distinct customer segments.

Based on the evaluation metrics, actionable insights can be extracted. These insights can be used to inform targeted marketing campaigns, optimize product development strategies, and enhance customer retention efforts. Understanding customer segments can help businesses tailor their approaches to better meet the needs and preferences of different customer groups.
